# OpenClaw Cognitive Upgrade Kit (Basic, Fixed)

**What this is**
A drop‑in MD file bundle that upgrades OpenClaw’s memory system and operational coherence. It’s designed for new installs and can be applied to existing agents.

**Outcome**
- Stronger persistent memory
- Prediction‑before‑action discipline
- Immediate error‑correction loops
- Reduced contradictions across sessions

## Quick Start (15 minutes)
1. Copy the files in this bundle into your **OpenClaw workspace root**.
2. Review **MEMORY-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md** and update placeholders.
3. Start OpenClaw and validate that memory checks are referenced in your session.

## Files Included
- **AGENTS.md** — core behavior rules + safety
- **SOUL.md** — tone, persona, operating principles
- **USER.md** — user profile template
- **MEMORY.md** — long‑term memory starter
- **HEARTBEAT.md** — periodic checks and memory upkeep
- **TOOLS.md** — environment notes
- **MEMORY-SYSTEM-GUIDE.md** — implementation guide
- **GLOBAL-STATE-SCHEMA.md** — structured state ledger spec
- **PREDICTION-PROTOCOL.md** — prediction‑before‑action routine
- **ERROR-DELTA-UPDATER.md** — update logic after actions
- **CONSISTENCY-RESOLVER.md** — contradiction detection rules
- **BENCHMARK-HARNESS.md** — tests to validate stability

## Success Criteria
- Fewer contradictions across sessions
- Clear prediction → action → correction loop
- Stable goal progression without manual repair

## Test Status
- ✅ Conversation tests passed on Docker test instance (memory location, global state ledger, error-delta, consistency resolver, daily refresh)


## New in v2
- **SELF-CHECK.md** adds mandatory preflight/postflight around actions.
- **examples/** provides worked end-to-end samples.
- **SAFETY-PRINCIPLES.md** replaces CONSTITUTION.md (compatibility pointer retained).

## Security and change control
This kit does not secure your device or workspace. It adds an owner-verification gate for protected actions that would change core kit behavior, and a lightweight AUDIT-LOG.md for approved changes. See SECURITY.md.
