# Custom Agent Creation Wizard — Workflow Guide

## Purpose
Enable founders to define their own agents safely without editing low-level files.

## Steps
1. Agent name
2. One-sentence role summary
3. Responsibility focus areas (guidance only)
4. Baseline autonomy preview (safe by default)
5. Create agent

## Safety Invariants
- CoS is always required
- Creating an agent does not grant permissions
- POLICY.yaml governs authority, not SOUL.md
- Irreversible actions remain forbidden unless explicitly granted
