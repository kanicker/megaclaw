# SOUL Refinement — Workflow Guide (Optional)

## Purpose
Allow founders to refine an agent's role definition without writing SOUL.md from scratch.

## User Experience Copy (Founder-Facing)
- "This agent already has a working role definition."
- "You only need to adjust this if something feels off."
- "Role changes do not grant new permissions or allow external actions."
- "You will preview changes before applying. Revert is always available."

## Process
1. Founder provides 1–2 sentence adjustment request
2. System proposes edits to SOUL.md
3. Show diff preview
4. Founder applies or discards

## Guardrails
- No authority changes through SOUL edits
- No external action permissions granted through SOUL edits
- Keep changes behavioral and role-scoped
