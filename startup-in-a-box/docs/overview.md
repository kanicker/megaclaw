# Overview — OpenClaw Startup‑in‑a‑Box v3.1

OpenClaw is a **file‑first, federated operating system** for AI‑run startups. It is designed for serious founders who want AI department heads to move quickly while preserving strategic coherence, accountability, and traceability.

## Core idea
- **Chat is transport. Files are truth.**
  Conversations are ephemeral; files are durable state. This prevents context loss, silent drift, and prompt injection from changing company structure or strategy.

## How it works
- **Human founder** is the ultimate authority.
- **AI Chief of Staff** integrates all department state into the Board Room.
- **AI department heads** act autonomously within their domain.
- **Weekly sync** reconciles local work into global company reality.

## Why it matters
LLMs are probabilistic and can drift. OpenClaw uses explicit, role‑scoped state to keep AI teams aligned without slowing them down.

## Intended users
- Founders/operators running AI‑heavy teams
- Teams who want speed **and** governance
- Builders who need fast iteration without strategic corruption
