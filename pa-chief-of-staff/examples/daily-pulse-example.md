# Daily Pulse — Example Output

## Pulse — 2026-02-14

**Priorities:**
1. Close Q1 revenue plan (due Feb 20) — on track, CFO review today at 10am
2. Finalize head of sales hire (due Feb 19) — decision memo ready, panel calibration at 2pm
3. Board update draft (due Feb 28) — not started, low urgency this week

**Decisions due:**
- Head of sales hire: recommendation and options framed. Decision by Feb 19.

**Commitments at risk:**
- None critical today. Board update has runway.

**Stakeholder touches:**
- Alex Rivera: next touch was Feb 13 (overdue). Recommend quick email today re: SLA progress.
- Jordan Chen: next touch Feb 15 (tomorrow). Monthly update draft needed.

**Risks:**
- Pipeline softness in segment B: mitigation in progress. SDR reallocation started this week.

**Memory maintenance:**
- Promoted to MEMORY.md: "Rivera prefers email over Slack for SLA updates" (from Feb 12 daily log).
- Context pressure: ✅ Safe (3% of injected file budget).

**Three moves today:**
1. CFO review at 10am — bring one-page revenue plan draft with assumptions labeled.
2. Hiring panel calibration at 2pm — bring decision memo with parallel track recommendation.
3. Send Alex Rivera a quick SLA update email (5 min, high relationship value).
